// Consumables found in lockers, boxes or lying around are a few small health, tool and ammo kits -
// the shared Shared/KitLoot.cs, published from GTFO.EZ - on top of the zone's normal resource packs.
// With Loot Mix on (it was GTFO.EZ.AbsurdWeapons'), the same run adds Hand Grenades and Stim Packs to
// the kits' lottery at their weights' odds, and leaves OutInTheOpenShare of the loot lying around
// the zone instead of in boxes. One run, one set of kit settings: Consumables Are Kits' (moved here
// from GTFO.EZ, same keys and defaults); GTFO.EZ.AbsurdWeapons' duplicates of them (KitLootPercent,
// HealthKitWeight, ...) are gone. GTFO.EZ, when installed, leaves its own consumable spawn odds
// alone while this is on, and its datablock tweaks (the consumable spawn multiplier, the zone
// resource budget the kit count follows) run first.
